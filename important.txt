Component Types

No official Differentiation but normally
Any frame work or library has the component type.

1) Stateful components ---> Containers
  : all about holding and managing data and passing data around to other components
  : In this project, App.svelte


2) Presentational components ---> Components
  : it might have some static data but the data is received from the outside
  and outputs it (which means rendering data in the browser.)  
  : in this project, MeetupItem.svelte, MeetupGrid.svelte
