Component Types

No official Differentiation but normally
Any frame work or library has the component type.

1) Stateful components ---> Containers
  : all about holding and managing data and passing data around to other components

2) Presentational components ---> Components
  : it might have some static data but the data is received from the outside
  and outputs it (which means rendering data in the browser.)
